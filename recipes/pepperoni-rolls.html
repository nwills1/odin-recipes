    <h1>Pepperoni Rolls</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>West Virginia pepperoni rolls are a classic Appalachian snack, consisting of soft, yeasty rolls filled with slices of pepperoni.<br>
        Originating from the coal mines of West Virginia in the early 20th century, these rolls were a convenient and filling meal for miners.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>1 pkg (2 1/4 tsp.) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 c. warm water (110&deg;)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. gradulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 c. all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      </ul>
    <p>For the filling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb. sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>2 c. shredded mozzarella cheese <em>(optional)</em></li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. <br> Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the activated yeast mixture, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour. Stir until the dough comes together.<br> 
          Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. <br>
          <em>(optional: use stand mixture with dough hook attachment)</em></li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
