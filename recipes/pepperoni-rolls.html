    <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>West Virginia pepperoni rolls are a classic Appalachian snack, consisting of soft, yeasty rolls filled with slices of pepperoni.
        Originating from the coal mines of West Virginia in the early 20th century, these rolls were a convenient and filling meal for miners.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <p class="ingredients">For the dough:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pkg (2 1/4 tsp.) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 c. warm water (110&deg;F or 41&deg;C)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. gradulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 c. all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      </ul>
   <p class="ingredients">For the filling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb. sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>2 c. shredded mozzarella cheese <em>(optional)</em></li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

     <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. <br> Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the activated yeast mixture, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour. Stir until the dough comes together.<br>
          Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. <br>
          <em>(optional: use stand mixture with dough hook attachment)</em></li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or grease them lightly.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 24 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten it into a small circle.</li>
        <li>Place a few slices of pepperoni and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese onto each circle of dough. Fold the dough over the filling and pinch the edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Arrange the filled rolls seam-side down on the prepared baking sheets. Cover them loosely with a kitchen towel and let them rise again for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Let the pepperoni rolls cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature as a delicious snack or meal on the go.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>These traditional West Virginia pepperoni rolls are best enjoyed fresh, but you can store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days (longer if refrigerated or frozen)<br> Reheat them briefly in the oven or microwave if preferred, but pepperoni rolls were traditionall sent with miners because they are equally delicious at room temperature.</p>
