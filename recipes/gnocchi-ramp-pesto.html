    <h1>Ramp &amp; Pistachio Pesto Gnocchi</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish celebrates the flavors of West Virginia's Appalachian culture with a modern twist. Ramps, a wild onion native to the region, are combined with earthy pistachios to create a vibrant pesto sauce that coats tender gnocchi. The dish is a harmonious blend of foraged ingredients and contemporary culinary techniques, paying homage to the rich culinary heritage of the Appalachian region.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb. pre-made or packaged gnocchi</li>
          <li>1 bunch ramps, cleaned and trimmed (about 8-10 ramps)</li>
          <li>1/2 c. shelled pistachios</li>
          <li>1/4 c. grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>1/4 c. extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste<br>
          <em>Optional:</em> cooked bacon or pancetta for serving</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the cleaned and trimmed ramps, shelled pistachios, grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse the ingredients until they are finely chopped.</li> 
        <li>With the food processor running, drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil until the pesto reaches a smooth consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi according to the package instructions until they float to the surface, indicating they are cooked through. </li>
        <li>Drain the gnocchi and set aside, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.
        <li>In a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet and toss to coat in the olive oil. Spoon the ramp and pistachio pesto over the gnocchi, tossing gently to combine.<br> <em>If the pesto is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to thin it out to your desired consistency.</em></li>
        <li>Divide the ramp and pistachio pesto gnocchi among serving plates. If desired, top each serving with crispy cooked bacon or pancetta for an added layer of flavor.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and freshly cracked black pepper. Serve immediately and enjoy the flavors of West Virginia's Appalachian culture!</li>
